1,Imran T.,Good one in this price segment.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
2,Manohar Reddy,Worst camera quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
3,Purushottam,Don‚Äôt buy from Amazon.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don‚Äôt buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.

8,Amazon Customer,Below average,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
9,Trupti,Dont buy samsung m12 mobile,1.0 out of 5 stars,  very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
10,Arun yadav,Worst product with cheap quality material.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
11,shobhit shrivastava,Not a good budget phone,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."

14,KK,"RUBBISH PHONE, WANT MY MONEY BACK",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
15,Srihari,Poor from Samsung,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
16,Thax,Samsung UI/UX is the worst,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
17,Amazon Customer,Go For It,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
18,manju,Worst camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
19,Amazon Customer,It's a budget package. A good phone to buy in the ‚Çπ 10k bracket.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
20,Divya M,Not recommended for Jiofiber users,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
21,TARAK SHAH,Phone üì± overall review,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Very good phone. Camera display speed very good. Weight is little heavy.  But worth compare to the price
22,Parth,Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
23,adityagehlot,PHONE NOT UPTO THE MARK,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
24,Vijay Krishna,Some marketing gimmicks...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone has 90hz display, but I see a lag while browing or navigating in apps, doesn't feel like 90hz at all48MP true cam when option selected gives noisy images , otherwise in normal mode works above averageBattery is excellent works for 2 daysHeating issues occur on heavy usage, in normal mode you won't notice itFront cam 8 mp just averageOverall I took 6gb 128 gb version for 13k and doesn't seem as good.Above average phone for the price...."
25,Arya 1808,This is my honest opinion,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Don't buy this if you want a primary device.I am using this as a secondary device so I don't have much problem .Firstly My iPad 's 1.2 Mp camera is much better than the so called 48MP camera.Software is a bit faulty- amazon music crashes on this device,  it is not able to connect the latest wifi version .If you still want if go for the 6gb variant .Around 2.5gb ram is occupied by the system .This phone is shorter in breadth and too much in length so this makes gaming experience very bad . Even though I just played mini militia.  üòÜConclusion-- this device is good for very very normal use .Pros :-- display is really good. Thanks to the 90hz display. Batter backup is just wow üëè"
26,Kulbir Sohil,Average Phone,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The price of the product is OK as per the price bracket. However it was nowhere compared to my old VIVO V5. Made a mistake exchanging the phone.The phone is average...
27,Anand Jaiswal,Samsung I love you,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Samsung is the beat
28,Siladittya Manna,Good for this price range except no dual band wifi support,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera picture quality not up to the par! But considering the price range, it is acceptable!But no 5GHz band support! Unacceptable in 2021!!90Hz screen refresh rate does not feel like 90Hz!Lot of lag is present! Don't know if that is a software bug!Battery performance is good!!Speakers are good, as expected.Overall, except the WiFi dual band support issue, rest is acceptable in this price range!!"
29,Amazon Customer,Awsome phone with brick size.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Recently I bought this galaxym12 for Rs.11k. Overall ok. But onething have to remember thst is thickness of the phone. Its 10mm THICK. Just like a brick in your pocket. Overall dimension of the phone also big. Hight , width, especialy thickness. Before i bought i didn't noticed the sizes of the this piece. Thats my mistake too. But u guys please concern about this review before you buy. Otherthan size completly ok at this price."
30,Amazon Customer,One of the best value for money phones,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Good- got it for 9999- decent phone for this cost with all the necessary gizmos and bling- finger print sensor is good. fast and sensitive. Haven't tried the face unlock.- display is top notch on any good Samsung phone for this price- quality pics/ decent ( note - I'm a normal user of camera )- battery is very good. its really a monsterBad ( depends on perspective )- slightly big for small hands- it has all the dumb samsung apps inbuilt ( you can uninstall a few )- slightly heavier when you have a good solid case ( read as spigen branded )Overall very happy to have a good ( more than decent ) phone for the initial offer price.
31,cbjairamreddy,Record sale good price good specs...,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I have Mo2s and this m12....better buy m12 you get better storage ram camera and finger scanner etc....record selling on Amazon...just checking performance...will give review after 1 month....overall good on specs....
32,Raghavendra,Performance & price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  In dis price u can afford M12 ...no doubt...overall excellent performance
33,SMBuyer,Worst Samsung phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
34,Dhayanithi,Excellent Battery  and budget,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone for more than a week and below is my feedback.1. Excellent battery and its lasts for 2 days at least on normal usage.2. Phone performance is good for normal usage such as YouTube,  Facebook or watsapp and usual games.3. Look and feel is good, easy to use.4. Phone is quite I feel probably due to battery  capacity.5. Front camera is not good but back one is good. This maybe great for selfie  lovers.6. Phone doesn't hang when multiple apps are opened.7. Worthy product  for this price based on spec and quality.I have attached  the photos taken and also same pic taken using both front and back camera  to show  the difference.  Overall it's a good budget Phone with all nice features and excellent battery."

37,naresh kumar,"Disappointed with mobile, Gpay & PhonePay app has issue",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
38,venkatesan,Good phone ü§≥üì± at reasonable price .,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I have bought 6GB Ram phone as I am long time user of Samsung and downgraded from high end series to this M series. D main reason u need to go for Samsung compared to China model phones is the SAR .SAR for this phone model is 1.19W/KG which is within the 1.6 range .Sound quality okayPicture quality is okay and not badBattery draining not that muchEase of navigation good üëçPerformance is goodThis phone comes with backside Matt finish and not glossy finish ..tats s only cosmetic changes compared to M31 series ..Over all okay üëåüôÇ ..head set won't be there which they mention in the items that they will provide..Overall decent price üëå
39,Sangeeta,Budget Samsung Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
40,Nutan Sinha,Everything is just lit at this priceüî• . No complains about anything,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
41,Sarang,"Good phone for a great price. Not a snapdragon chip, but that is not an issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazon did a great job with the delivery of this product. Ordered and received on the same day.On the phone: I am happy with it. Have been using this phone for 3 days. The battery lasts for 1and half days with gaming and binge watching videos.The screen is comfortable. No issues on the screen, though  it is not amoled for an average user it is not a big difference.For the price this is a great buy, of course there is no snapdragon chip. But the exynos 850 is 8nm and at this price point is comparable to most snapdragon 6series chipsets.Camera is decent. As long as you are not a professional photographer,  this will be good enough to take atleast average if not great pics. (Some  pics are really great).This is definitely not an iPhone or one plus. But for the price it definitely is great."
42,Ravindra,Best Budget phone in last few years and it‚Äôs so smooth,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  No need to underestimate exynos 850, with 90Hz refresh rate.it‚Äôs not disappointed me. I bought it as second phone(I use iPhone SE 2020).With normal use more then 48hrs still 44% battery leftFingerprint sensor is unbelievable it‚Äôs so quickCamera is decent enough to capture picturesDisplay Quality is GoodOverall I felt good for buying it for 9999/- with ICICI credit card offer.It‚Äôs worth buying, it‚Äôs far better than other MI with same price (10999-12999 in 4GB -64GB ) as Samsung don‚Äôt irritate with adds and also more secured"
43,Dza ralte,"Camera,  processor,  battery are ok and being satisfied my expectations",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  After a long span of time say 3 years, im back to Samsung. Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now.However,  as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable.I can make accurate opinion after using a longer period say, 2/3 years"
44,Mohammed j.,Very very Poor network connection,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Plz do not buy this mobile.. I am facing poor network issue. In my home others are using without any interruption.. Tried many things.. Asked colleagues, neighbors, mobile store person, google and tried all the ways.. But internet is very slow.. The same sim is working fine in other devise in same location. Even internet is ON it is showing you are offline when i try something. Also took nore than 45 mins to download 72 mb size app. Atlast i cancelled and came out due to intolerance. I am placing return order, will see what is gonna happen."
45,Akhil Hari,Better buy a brick!,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Don't know if I could get more disappointed by a purchase!!The phone did look okayish in the spec sheet. But it is a very  stupid buy.The first thing you notice is  the IMPRACTICALITY of the phone.It is too heavy(220g) and too thick (about 1cm) to carry. The display is the worst anyone could get at this price point.The processor is reasonably slow. Face detection is a joke. Battery is 6000 mah but will take forever to charge. But the side fingerprint sensor was good .Camera was okayish. Add a few more bucks and buy a better phone with OLED display.
46,ABHIK,Great budget phone üì±üëå,5.0 out of 5 stars,  In an affordable range this is a good phone to purchase. Loved the way it performes with its special features like 90hz display speed 6000mh battery and decent camera quality. If someone compares it with high budget phones and criticize then for them better to go expensive. Overall it's a great budget phone üì±..
47,Preet,"Got more than expected, at this price point.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Much better than expectations and that too a brand like Samsung at this cost. Rest time will tell. But so far everything is just perfect. Was not aware that it had face recognition and finger print read. Though the phone is not that sleek and on the bulkier side, but I think that makes it even more durable and solid. And Rs. 1000/- off on ICICI credit card was icing on cake. Forget other brands. Need not say anything else. Totally impressed. Bought another one in black for my daughter and she too is in awe, even though she was using an IPhone 6 S. And it has been mentioned on the box, that it is manufactured in India. Another plus point. One can go for it with eyes closed, if budget is around Rs. 10k approx. If one is ok and satisfied with the features offered. Happy shopping."
48,Vince,Best Phone @12499 for 6 GB RAM/128 GB ROM Variant,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:1. Best Battery i.e. 6000mAh.2. Good Back camera.3. Good and very necessary features by Samsung One UI. (I bet you'll like it)4. Good Performance (I use a lot of apps in multitasking but I don't play games so can't review gaming performance).5. Supports 15WT fast charging.6. Display is good according to the price range. (Don't get confused on poor display reviews.)7. Side positioned fingerprint sensor is good. (In starting you can face problems if you are currently using a back fingerprint sensor)8. Low light image from the back camera is also good. One attached in the image.9. Currently(11/04/21- 15/04/21) this phone is available @11700 (effective price)using Indusind bank cards so it is a loot deal for now. (Lowest ever price for this phone)Cons:1. Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it)2. Phone is very heavy and big in size.3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark.4.Animations are a little bit slow.5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x. (Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x that's why the phone seems a little bit slow)."
49,Mahidhar,Good battery but average performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
50,NISHANT SINGH,Just a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
51,Saurav M.,"Good for average usage; no wifi calling, speaker volume very low",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good phone for average daily use. I am slightly disappointed as wifi calling feature is missing. My old M30 had wifi calling two years ago. Also, the call volume is very low, I have to press against my ear to listen to calls."
52,Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd A/c vimal patel,Payment issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Product is okayBut I cancelled order to get discount by paying for the same product by credit card.Disappointed that it was rejected.
53,Karan M.,Overall Basic Phone by Samsung,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its like a pure Samsung stock Android phoneEverything is customisable ,its easy to use no lags or glitchesGames run smoothly COD , Asphalt 9 etcCall Quality is goodThere is no wifi 6 feature ( not everyone has wifi 6 at home yet)Overall a great simple phone must buy!!!! Just Rs 10,000/-"
54,Kanthi mathi,Best batteryPretty good deal .Luv Samsung and Amazon for fast delivery and deals,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This phone is the best in this price range with best battery and camera performance. I would have more pleased if it had an amoled display . Surely Samsung had the ability to imply an amoled screen but they didn't . They could have used Snap dragon 600 series chipset instead of the exynos. But still this is the best phone under this budget. Better that A21s of Samsung . It's the best 10k budget phone now. Don't get confused with f12 it's just same as M12.
55,Kiran@MusicLover,One of the best smart phone in this price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Decent phone.. people say VGA cam because they didn't notice that the aspect ratio for 48 MP camera.. 48 MP cam option is only for 3:4 aspect ratio..And yea its true that the wifi doesn't support 5G bandwidth..  but over all decent mobile for decent price, Got 6GB version for 11.300 using coupon and credit cardThanking Amazon, IndusInd and Samsung!Posted pics are Shot by me on Samsung M12,Those who dont believe they can ask me for Camera Settings."
56,Kushal,Worst Samsung for me.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Had some expectations. Worst mobile experience. I might be happy if I have bought this phone 4 years back. Such a bad touch screen slogging performance. Nothing is good in this
57,Anand,Writing this post after using the phone for one week,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera quality is awesome, no compromise on the quality.Battery life is excellent, for my usage of approx 20 nos long call of 5 - 20 mins average, and corporate emails.... Usage the battery is lasting for almost 3 full days. Battery is seriously a Monster.Fingerprint reader is an average one... No comments!!!  Overall for the price of 10k (i got 2k discount from amazon and 1k for using icici card) this is an excellent product from Samsung. Also to mention the Android v11 is loaded... No compromise in security related flaws. Excellent phone... Go for it!!!!!"
58,Hemant Chhabra,A budget phone for normal users not for Gaming,4.0 out of 5 stars,  A decent phone but not meant for heavy tasking..Screen is  decent..Samsung UI is working good.Sound is Decent ..Charging time is little bit Higher due to huge battery ( Approx 3 Hours for 0-100%)and charging wire is very small.Camera is good.Fingerprint Scanner is decent.Phone is little bit Heavy but its easy to handle.Phone is for  normal user not for gaming as sometime phone feels that exynos 850processor is not providing full power.
59,Jeevaraj,"Excellent camera, good battery and awesome fingerprint reader",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  M12 is fulfilled my expectations completely, hats off to Samsung. Quality camera and fingerprint reader are best of this range. Especially big battery gives good support for online classes without interruption, totally we are well satisfied with product."
60,Sourabh Kashyap,"Battery, overall performance is really awesome.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good buy within the price  range, this thing is powerfull, the one's looking for performance this is the product, 6 gb ram with 128gb to access with is worthy. The system has variety  of settings to choose from, this might get slow when google drive is being used for contacts and other things as it directly fetches data from drive but there are other settings you can play with and enjoy games at a very good speed.. And the charger is powerful.Recommendation for games: try games from ppsspp emulator."
61,r singh,"Awesome phone, very long battery life, great feel",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am writing this review after 3 days of usage. I have upgraded to this phone from a Redmi 5A. Looks and feel are simply amazing. The usage experience is also superb. The battery life seems to be v v long, when compared to my last phone. Overall, I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase. Seems like a real upgrade from my old Redmi 5A... and, to top it all, Amazon gave me an exchange offer worth Rs. 2500 on my 3 year old Redmi 5A... I have nothing to complain.Last but not the least, the delivery experience was also superb... delivered within 2 days !!! And the delivery guy was also very helpful and patient as it took more than half an hour to reset my old phone before handing it over to him.Overall a 5 star experience... However, I would have loved to give a 6-star for battery life as well as the delivery experience."
62,Bala,Below Average product from Samsung,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Except battery life.. rest other options like camera, display , software are all useless. If Mobile size comes under 6 or 6'4 inch then it will be preferable for elder people(above 50 age). Over all it fails in all segments. Micromax in 1 is far better than M12"
63,Amazon Customer,Average phone considering price range,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Average phone considering price range.1. Camera quality: average, no slow motion or time lapse feature available, no zoom when using 48mp. Front camera, below average. Sometimes I take a photo that doesn't get stored, quite annoying.2. Weight: quite heavy, you feel the difference when you take some other phone in your hand.3. screen type: lcd not led or amoled4. Batter life: looks good with normal usage.5. Phone body: back panel looks like of plastic, it would have been better if matelic had been used.6: user interface: sometimes very hard to do something, like taking a screenshot. Could have been given some better option to do that. Also, I use night model, where it gets better into grayscale in night, I can't customize some options like what apps and what type of do not disturb I want, also if had turn it off in some urgent cases I have to go back into settings and then disable it. Not an easy option provided.Face recognition: not fast and accurate."

67,Amazon Customer,Regrettable purchase,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  They have conveniently skipped mentioning it is not an amoled display while mentioning 90 Hz refresh rate. Touch response is faulty on these phones and SAR value is high despite having exynos processor, which also they have conveniently skipped mentioning."

69,Samarth Asija,DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz WiFi BANDS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Such an awesome phone ruined by a biggest lack of a most important and basic feature, GREAT battery life, camera, UI, lives up to its reputation;Great specs all round, only thing to be vary of is that it DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz band wifi ‚Äú5G wifi‚ÄùWhen you buy a phone with such great specs, it‚Äôs a real shame that the only thing slowing it down is a lack of fast internet speeds due to hardware limitation. Not having support for 5GHz in 2021 is ü§Æü§Æ"

71,Krishna Kumar,After 1 week of use,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This product is fantastic for this price! I tested the Battery life and for a heavy user, it can easily last you and day or a day and a half. And for a light user, it can last you 2 - 3 days! Also, the cameras are decent, the front camera is ok in low light or in some cases indoor lighting, but the front camera is pretty good! I have seen phones with these exact same features for double the price! The screen is respectable it's not pixely, but it's not the best ofc. The screen is pretty smooth, its 90hz is really nice and smooth. Gaming on this phone is ok. I mean like I told you the battery can last you a long time, and the same thing applies to gaming now ofc the battery will run out faster but not significantly faster. Playing the actual game its self is decent only the VERY high-powered games is a bit laggy on this phone but most of the games work smoothly. I would give this phone a 4 star just because the front camera could have been better."

78,amit kumar,Camera Quality and Colour +Performance,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst Samsung Mobile Ever. used so many different Samsung mobiles. but M12 is just cheating by Samsung. The camera quality is so poor. It's just a VGA camera, not 48-megapixel screen colors are very low. I have a galaxy j8 its camera is lower than m12 but it is sharp. don't take they will not return the product. worst Samsung phone ever. lost 13500, and amazon service is being poor day by day."

It takes some time in charging, but if we see the battery size, it's normal.cons: you cant use s secure app to secure your  apps and folder, as its not compatible with this phone, and Samsung has compromised in many features.If you dont play heavy games, you can go with this."
80,Sanjay,"Awesome phone within 10K budget, a sure shot Redmi killer",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Simply an amazing smartphone from Samsung within 10k, a rival killer launched. Bought this for my dad and he is extremely satisfied with the performance, camera is decent enough, sound quality is pretty good and battery life is awesome!! Grip is good with the combi finish at the back. On the cons, a bit on the heavier side and slightly thicker compared to its rivals, but definitely not a deal breaker. With 90 Hz refresh rate, the pros surely weigh high over the cons, just go for it."

83,Amazon Customer,It seems Samsung  has delivered  what they have been promoting in Galaxy M12,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I got this phone for my second contact number as my primary handset  battery  runs out very fast and I usually have very long days. But this phone's battery  really  amazed me . It's only 3.5 days I am using  but I can tell you that the battery  backup  is really  good . My first full charge ran for full 3 days with moderate usage. Looks good . UI is simple with Android 11.  Weight and grip is good . Screen is responsive .

87,RENUKUMAR TS,Truly Worth to Buy This Reloaded Monster - Samsung M12,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Samsung is truly a Monster with 6000 mAh battery with 8 nm processor. 128 GB Internal memory is really good to have along with 6 gb RAM where the games r loading very smoothly. True 48 Mp quad camera is truly wise to capture the photos. The phone is very slim and 90 hz refresh rate is really awesome. 16.55 cm infinity V display is cool. In total this mobile is one of the best to have at this range of prices. Moreover the backside of the phone is having a matte finish which is very good and not slippery.
